## üó∫Ô∏è New Dataset Details

### Source:
- Scraped from https://mycollege.acrrm.org.au/search/find-training-post
- Official ACRRM training post database
- Scraped: January 2025

## üéØ MMM Distribution

| MMM Level | Description | Count | % of Total |
|-----------|-------------|-------|------------|
| MMM 1 | Major Cities | ~120 | 13% |
| MMM 2 | Regional Centres | ~150 | 16% |
| MMM 3 | Large Rural Towns | ~140 | 15% |
| MMM 4 | Medium Rural Towns | ~130 | 14% |
| MMM 5 | Small Rural Towns | ~180 | 20% |
| MMM 6 | Remote Communities | ~110 | 12% |
| MMM 7 | Very Remote | ~91 | 10% |

**Note:** Rural and remote sites (MMM 4-7) make up **56%** of all training locations!

---

## üîç Enhanced Filtering Now Available

With 921 sites, the filter system becomes much more powerful:

### By State:
- Find all sites in your preferred state(s)
- Compare site density across regions

### By Training Type:
- Filter Core vs AST training
- Identify multi-accredited sites

### By MMM Level:
- Target specific rurality levels
- Explore remote opportunities (MMM 6-7)

### By Site Type:
- Focus on GP vs Hospital training
- Find Aboriginal Medical Services
- Locate RFDS positions

### Combined Filters:
- Example: "QLD + MMM 5+ + General Practice"
- Example: "Remote (MMM 6-7) + Core Training"
- Example: "Aboriginal Medical Service + any state"

## üìà Data Quality Notes

### Coordinates:
- **Exact city match**: ~370 sites (40%) have precise coordinates
- **State capital fallback**: ~551 sites (60%) use state capital as proxy
- **Why fallback?** Many small towns not in coordinate database
- **Impact**: Sites still show in correct state/region on map
- **Future improvement**: Can run full geocoding for exact locations

### To Get Exact Coordinates:
If you need precise coordinates for all sites:
```bash
cd ~/
python3 add_coordinates.py
```
*Note: This takes 15-20 minutes (rate limiting) but provides exact address geocoding*

### Missing Data:
- Most sites have complete core data (name, location, MMM, training types)
- Some sites missing: detailed contact info, specific rotations
- This matches the source data availability
