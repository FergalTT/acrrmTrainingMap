# ‚è≥ Geocoding In Progress

## Status: RUNNING ‚úÖ

The full geocoding process is currently running in the background to get **exact latitude/longitude coordinates** for all 921 training sites.

---

## üìä Process Details

### What's Happening:
- **Script**: `/Users/fergaltemple/add_coordinates.py`
- **Process ID**: 66241 (check with `ps aux | grep add_coordinates`)
- **Input**: `/Users/fergaltemple/acrrm-all-sites.json` (921 sites)
- **Output**: `/Users/fergaltemple/acrrm-all-sites-with-coords.json`
- **Log File**: `/Users/fergaltemple/geocoding_progress.log`

### Timing:
- **Total Sites**: 921
- **Rate Limit**: 1 request per second (Nominatim requirement)
- **Estimated Time**: 15-20 minutes
- **Progress Saves**: Every 50 sites

### Why It Takes Time:
- Must respect Nominatim's rate limit (1 req/sec)
- Makes HTTP requests to OpenStreetMap geocoding service
- Geocodes each address: street, city, state, postcode
- Saves progress every 50 sites to prevent data loss

---

## üîç Monitor Progress

### Check if still running:
```bash
ps aux | grep "add_coordinates.py" | grep -v grep
```

### Watch the log file (live updates):
```bash
tail -f ~/geocoding_progress.log
```
Press Ctrl+C to stop watching

### Check progress count:
```bash
grep -c "Success\|Failed" ~/geocoding_progress.log
```

### See last 20 lines:
```bash
tail -20 ~/geocoding_progress.log
```

### Check how many sites processed so far:
```bash
grep "\[.*\/921\]" ~/geocoding_progress.log | tail -1
```

---

## ‚è∞ Expected Timeline

Starting from when you ran the script:

| Time | Sites Processed | % Complete |
|------|----------------|------------|
| 0 min | 0 | 0% |
| 2 min | ~120 | 13% |
| 5 min | ~300 | 33% |
| 8 min | ~480 | 52% |
| 10 min | ~600 | 65% |
| 13 min | ~780 | 85% |
| 15 min | ~900 | 98% |
| **16-17 min** | **921** | **100%** ‚úÖ |

*Note: Times are approximate based on 1 req/sec + processing overhead*

---

## ‚úÖ When Complete

The script will:
1. Print "Geocoding complete!" to the log
2. Show final statistics (successful vs failed)
3. Save complete file to `/Users/fergaltemple/acrrm-all-sites-with-coords.json`
4. Exit automatically

### Check if complete:
```bash
tail -10 ~/geocoding_progress.log
```

Look for:
```
============================================================
Geocoding complete!
Successful: XXX/921 (XX.X%)
Failed: XX/921 (X.X%)

Saving to /Users/fergaltemple/acrrm-all-sites-with-coords.json...
Done!
```

---

## üìà What Happens After

### Automatic Next Steps:
Once geocoding completes, run:

```bash
# Copy exact coordinates to map data
cp ~/acrrm-all-sites-with-coords.json ~/acrrm-training-map/data/training-sites-full.json

# Start the map to see exact locations
cd ~/acrrm-training-map
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 and you'll see all 921 sites at their **exact geocoded locations** instead of state capital fallbacks!

---

## üõë If You Need to Stop

### Stop the process:
```bash
kill 66241
```

Or find the PID first:
```bash
ps aux | grep "add_coordinates.py" | grep -v grep
kill [PID]
```

### Resume later:
The script saves progress every 50 sites. If stopped, it will start from the beginning but skip sites that already have coordinates.

---

## üìä Expected Results

### Geocoding Success Rate:
Based on the address data quality, expect:
- **85-95% success rate** (exact coordinates)
- **5-15% failures** (will use fallback: Australian center -25.2744, 133.7751)

### Common reasons for failures:
- Very small towns not in OpenStreetMap database
- Incomplete or ambiguous addresses
- Remote locations without street addresses
- PO Box addresses

### Don't worry if some fail:
- Sites with failed geocoding will still appear on the map
- They'll be marked with `"geocoding_failed": true`
- You can manually correct coordinates later if needed
- Most major training sites will geocode successfully

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Process seems stuck:
```bash
# Check if process is running
ps aux | grep add_coordinates

# Check log file size (should be growing)
ls -lh ~/geocoding_progress.log

# See latest activity
tail ~/geocoding_progress.log
```

### Network issues:
If you see many geocoding failures in a row:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Nominatim might be having issues
3. Let the script complete - it will mark failures
4. Can re-run later for failed sites only

### Python errors:
Check the log for error messages:
```bash
grep -i "error\|exception\|traceback" ~/geocoding_progress.log
```

---

## üí° Tips While Waiting

While geocoding runs (15-20 minutes), you can:

1. ‚úÖ **Set up your Notion databases** - Follow `NOTION_SETUP.md`
2. ‚úÖ **Read the documentation** - Check out `DATA_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md`
3. ‚úÖ **Plan your training pathway** - Review training requirements
4. ‚úÖ **Explore ACRRM resources** - Visit official curriculum pages
5. ‚úÖ **Import CSV template to Notion** - Get started with training timeline

The geocoding will complete in the background while you work!

## üìù Quick Reference

### Key Files:
- **Input**: `~/acrrm-all-sites.json` (Original scraped data)
- **Output**: `~/acrrm-all-sites-with-coords.json` (With exact coordinates)
- **Map Data**: `~/acrrm-training-map/data/training-sites-full.json` (For the app)
- **Log**: `~/geocoding_progress.log` (Progress tracking)
- **Script**: `~/add_coordinates.py` (Geocoding script)

### Quick Commands:
```bash
# Monitor progress
tail -f ~/geocoding_progress.log

# Check if running
ps aux | grep add_coordinates

# See count
grep -c "\[.*\/921\]" ~/geocoding_progress.log

# When complete, update map
cp ~/acrrm-all-sites-with-coords.json ~/acrrm-training-map/data/training-sites-full.json
```

## ‚è∞ Check Back In ~17 Minutes!

The geocoding should be complete in approximately **15-20 minutes** from when you started it.

Come back and check:
```bash
tail -20 ~/geocoding_progress.log
```

If you see "Done!" at the end, geocoding is complete! üéâ

Then just copy the file and restart your map to see all 921 sites at their exact locations.

---

**Started**: Check the log for start time
**Expected Completion**: ~17 minutes from start
**Status**: Running in background (PID 66241)

üìç **Next**: Check progress in 10-15 minutes, or monitor the log file for real-time updates!
